 /**
  * Explanation
  When a new thread is created, the thread is in the NEW state. 
  When .start() method is called on a thread, the thread scheduler moves it to Runnable state. 
  Whenever join() method is called on a thread instance, the current thread executing that statement will wait for this thread to move to Terminated state. 
  So, before the final statement is printed on the console, the program calls join() on thread2 making the thread1 wait while thread2 completes its execution and is moved to Terminated state. 
  thread1 goes to Waiting state because it is waiting for thread2 to complete itâ€™s execution as it has called join on thread2.
