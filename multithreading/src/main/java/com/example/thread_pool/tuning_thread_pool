Tuning Thread Pool

The optimum size of the thread pool depends on the number of processors available and the nature of the tasks. 
On a N processor system for a queue of only computation type processes, 
a maximum thread pool size of N or N+1 will achieve the maximum efficiency.

But tasks may wait for I/O and in such a case we take into account the ratio of waiting time(W) and service time(S) for a request; 
resulting in a maximum pool size of N*(1+ W/S) for maximum efficiency.
