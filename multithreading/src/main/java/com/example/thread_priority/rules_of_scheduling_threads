1. If two threads have the same priority then we can’t expect which thread will execute first. 
It depends on the thread scheduler’s algorithm(Round-Robin, First Come First Serve, etc)

2. If we are using thread priority for thread scheduling then we should always keep in mind 
that the underlying platform should provide support for scheduling based on thread priority.
