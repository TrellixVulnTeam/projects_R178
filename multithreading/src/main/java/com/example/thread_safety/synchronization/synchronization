Using Synchronization
Synchronization is the process of allowing only one thread at a time to complete the particular task. 
It means when multiple threads executing simultaneously, and want to access the same resource at the same time, 
then the problem of inconsistency will occur. so synchronization is used to resolve inconsistency problem by allowing only one thread at a time. 

Synchronization uses a synchronized keyword. 
Synchronized is the modifier that creates a block of code known as a critical section.
