Synchronized methods enables a simple strategy for preventing the thread interference and memory consistency errors.
If a Object is visible to more than one threads, all reads or writes to that Objectâ€™s fields are done through the synchronized method.

It is not possible for two invocations for synchronized methods to interleave. 
If one thread is executing the synchronized method,
all others thread that invoke synchronized method on the same Object will have to wait until first thread is done with the Object.

There can be two trains (more than two) which need to use same at same time so there is chance of collision. 
Therefore to avoid collision we need to synchronize the line in which multiple want to run.

Synchronized access to getLine() method on the same Object
