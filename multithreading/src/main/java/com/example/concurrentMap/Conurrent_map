ConcurrentMap Interface in java

ConcurrentMap is an interface and it is a member of the Java Collections Framework, 
which is introduced in JDK 1.5 represents a Map that is capable of handling concurrent access to it without affecting the consistency of entries in a map. 
ConcurrentMap interface present in java.util.concurrent package. 
It provides some extra methods apart from what it inherits from the SuperInterface i.e. java.util.Map.
It has inherited the Nested Interface Map.Entry<K, V>. 

HashMap operations are not synchronized, while Hashtable provides synchronization.
Though Hashtable is a thread-safe, it is not very efficient.
To solve this issue, the Java Collections Framework introduced ConcurrentMap in Java 1.5.
